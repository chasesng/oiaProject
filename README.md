## FAQ

#### There are ingredients with no data recorded, is this an issue?

I will be updating the 'ingredients' database from time to time, so that users will have a more fruitful experience using this application.

#### Will there be more products added?

I have intentions to add more products in due course, but there are many challenges to this.
For one, ingredients are not always found in the same place you may find the product. Ingredients are more often than not typed erroneously by the company, or written in a different way, (eg. Water being 'Aqua'). I have, for the most part, resolved this issue best as I can, but to ensure all ingredients and products are accurately represented, I will not be hastening the adding of products.

#### When will the mobile application be available?

The mobile application is set to be pushed to the app store / play store when its ready. Paired with a few features I might be inclined to add at a later date, the moment it is available for download will be when the application has been used for an extended period of time and allowed for proper bug testing and trials to be done.
